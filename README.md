# Tableau Project - Emergency Room Dashboard


## Overview
This Tableau project aims to provide insights into the emergency room (ER) data, focusing on various aspects such as the number of patients visiting the ER, average patient satisfaction, average wait time, patient race, patient age, and department referral data. The data used in this project was sourced from data.world, ensuring its reliability and accuracy.


## Dashboard Features
1.**Number of Patients**:This visualization presents the overall count of patients visiting the ER, allowing for a quick understanding of the patient load.
2.**Average Patient Satisfaction**:This chart displays the average satisfaction rating given by patients after their ER visit. It helps identify trends and potential areas for improvement.
3.**Average Wait Time**:The average wait time visualization provides an overview of the time patients spend waiting in the ER. It highlights any prolonged wait times that require attention.
4.**Patient Race:**:This chart showcases the distribution of patients across different racial categories. It enables a better understanding of the demographics of patients visiting the ER.
5.**Patient Age**:The patient age visualization displays the distribution of patients' ages. It helps identify any specific age groups that frequently visit the ER and supports demographic analysis.
6.**Department Referral**:This chart illustrates the number of patients referred to the ER by various departments. It identifies the departments with the highest referral rates and assists in resource allocation.
7.**Heat Map**:This heatmap provides an intuitive visualization of the days and hours when patients visit the ER. The color intensity represents the average time spent by patients during those specific periods. It helps identify high-traffic periods and potential bottlenecks in ER operations.
